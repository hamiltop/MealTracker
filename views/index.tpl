      <p>One of the easiest ways to save money is to periodically review where you spend it.  After months of keeping track of my grocery bills, I still had no idea why we were spending so much money.</p>

        One of the first things to do is to keep track of your purchases.  Knowing how much things have cost in the past and how much they should cost is useful not only on <em>The Price Is Right</em>.  It's the first step towards understanding your meal costs.  Use Meal Tracker to calculate your average costs for ingredients.

        Once you know how much your ingredients cost, you can figure out how much each meal costs.  While it's clear that rice and beans will cost less than steak and potatoes, we sometimes don't know how much we spend on our average meals. Once you have your ingredient costs figured out, you can use Meal Tracker to calculate how much your meals cost.
