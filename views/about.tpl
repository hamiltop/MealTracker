%rebase layout title="About Meal Tracker"

<p>
Meal tracker was created to solve multiple problems.  The first was that my wife and I somehow spent $500 on groceries in a month, almost double what we usually spend, and I had no idea why.  The second was that I wanted to learn CouchDB.  The third was that I needed a project for my Internet Programming course in school.

The application is built on Bottle.py, CouchDB, and Twitter Bootstrap.  I'm pretty sure I could get something like this running on Rails in a day, but learning CouchDB has made the process much more interesting.
